    "output": "{\n  \"overview\": \"Here’s a detailed professional analysis of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS), blending market data, news sentiment, technical chart insights, price action, and dynamically computed risk levels to guide your next steps.\",\n  \"MarketSnapshot\": \"As of the latest close, TCS is trading at ₹3435.70. The daily high and low are ₹3446.30 and ₹3410.90 respectively, with the previous close at ₹3424.00. The 52-week range is between ₹3056.05 and ₹4592.25, meaning the current price sits in the lower-middle of its yearly spectrum, indicating a period of consolidation after pulling back from higher levels. Over the past five trading sessions, closing prices were ₹3496.30, ₹3515.30, ₹3451.40, ₹3424.00, and ₹3435.70 — this sequence reflects a short-term downward bias with stabilizing signs. Trading volume peaked mid-week then softened, now slightly below five-day averages, indicating some indecision or waning bearish momentum. The trending indicator hints at mild bearishness consolidating toward a sideways market.\",\n  \"NewsAnalysis\": \"Recent news is shaped by sectorwise headwinds. The first highlight is Accenture’s 11% share price drop even after strong revenues due to challenging forward guidance, which led not only to Accenture’s stock decline but also pressured Indian IT firms like Infosys. This caused ripple effects across the IT sector, including TCS, despite company-specific news being minimal. Another article discusses ongoing challenges for IT outsourcers — muted client spending tied to war, tariffs, and global macro uncertainties. The overall news tone is moderately negative, with focus on sector-wide caution and not on TCS fundamentals specifically. External events and industry-wide risks are determining sentiment currently, making the general mood tempered but not outrightly bearish.\",\n  \"TechnicalChartInterpretation\": \"The daily chart displays a series of bearish candles followed by smaller-bodied candles, suggesting selling pressure has ebbed and a consolidation phase is underway. There was no clear bullish reversal pattern at present, but the loss of downside momentum is evident. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicates that bearish momentum is waning, with the gap between MACD and signal line narrowing and the histogram flattening. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 39.12, near-but-not-in oversold territory, suggesting room for upside if positive catalysts emerge. Volume is slightly lower than the week’s peak, which usually implies sellers are pausing. Key support sits around ₹3410–3420 while immediate resistance is seen at ₹3450; any close above this zone could be a sign of further recovery.\",\n  \"PriceActionAnalysis\": \"TCS’s latest price action paints a picture of lower highs and lower lows transitioning into a stabilization period, as buyers start to defend levels above ₹3410. The absence of further breakdowns and emergence of small-range candlesticks indicate indecision, with the selling force depleted for now. While price failed to form a classic reversal setup (like a bullish engulfing or hammer), this mild base-building above ₹3410 is a constructive first step. Traders may consider mapping additional supports using Fibonacci retracements from recent swings, but price is clearly consolidating and awaiting a directional trigger. This aligns with subdued momentum visible in the technical indicators.\",\n  \"StrategyAndRiskAssessment\": \"Given TCS’s bluechip status and relatively low short-term ATR (~₹56.6), dynamic stop-loss can be set one ATR below current price (around ₹3379.1, or 1.6% lower), reflecting the latest volatility profile. With risk/reward at 2:1, the initial profit target stands at ₹3548.9 (or 3.3% higher). The preferred entry zone is between ₹3430–3440, close to current market levels and near recent support. Exits can be planned just before encroaching on stronger resistance areas, as the risk of reversal grows closer to ₹3450 and above. News-driven sector volatility suggests stops might be placed on the slightly wider side, but not excessively so given TCS’s large-cap stability. For current holders, a trailing stop under ₹3410 can preserve capital and prevent drawdowns if weakness resumes. Green flags include convergence of support levels and RSI rebound; red flags would be a fresh break below ₹3410 with renewed volume or additional negative sector news.\",\n  \"DynamicLevels\": {\n    \"StopLoss\": \"₹3379.1 (1.6% below entry at current price)\",\n    \"ProfitTarget\": \"₹3548.9 (3.3% above entry at current price)\",\n    \"EntryZone\": \"₹3430–₹3440 (current market price, near support and value area)\",\n    \"ExitZone\": \"₹3540–₹3550 (around the next major resistance and measured move projection)\"\n  },\n  \"Final Commentary\": \"TCS is currently in a phase of technical consolidation, trading within a well-defined range while sector turbulence inhibits immediate bullish potential. The calculated stop and target levels are designed to adapt to actual, recent volatility, not arbitrary thresholds. While technical signals suggest sellers have lost intensity, strong buying confirmation is yet to emerge. Investors should remain patient and disciplined, ensuring position sizes reflect their personal risk tolerance, and closely monitor sector news for changes in sentiment. Should you hold TCS or plan a fresh entry, keep an eye on the ₹3410 support and execute plans only if price action confirms a reversal in sentiment. If you need deeper analysis (e.g., longer-term outlook, detailed Fibo mapping, or sector peer comparisons), feel free to ask!\"\n}"
