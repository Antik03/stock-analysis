    "output": "{\n  \"overview\": \"This TCS stock analysis covers trend, drivers, support/resistance, volume, sentiment, risk, and actionable insights—synthesizing chart, data, and news for an institutional-grade, actionable overview tailored to current market realities.\",\n  \"MarketSnapshot\": \"TCS is currently trading at ₹3,435.70, after a session that saw a high of ₹3,446.30 and a low of ₹3,410.90. Over the past five trading days, it experienced a stepwise decline from ₹3,496.30 to ₹3,435.70. The 52-week range extends from ₹3,056.05 to ₹4,592.25, placing the current price in the lower-middle of its annual band. Trading volume spiked on the sharpest down days, then moderated as prices stabilized—indicating some capitulation selling and a likely shift to consolidation. The recent closing pattern with smaller daily moves suggests the bearish momentum has decelerated and a short-term base may be forming.\",\n  \"NewsAnalysis\": \"Recent news heavily highlights sector concerns rather than TCS-specific issues. Key headlines include Accenture's 11% share price drop on cautious guidance, which has dragged down sentiment for all Indian IT majors. Broader narratives center on macro headwinds—muted client spending, global uncertainty, and risk-aversion driven by wars and tariffs. While not directly targeting TCS, this creates a backdrop of cautious sentiment. The sector news can increase volatility, but no company-specific red flags for TCS have emerged. The tone is moderately negative, suggesting caution is warranted even though no direct operational issues have been reported for TCS.\",\n  \"TechnicalChartInterpretation\": \"The 5-day candlestick chart shows consistent downward movement followed by smaller-bodied candles, a classic sign of fading bearishness and indecision. There is no clear bullish reversal pattern forming yet. The RSI at 39.12 is near oversold, reflecting a market that has sold off but may not be ready for a sustained rebound without a catalyst. Recent volume spikes on declines and subsequent cool-off signal that most urgent selling may have passed. The MACD narrowing and lack of further downside reinforce the consolidation thesis. Support is well-defined at ₹3,410, and resistance stands at ₹3,445–3,450; a breakout from this range will likely set the next directional move.\",\n  \"PriceActionAnalysis\": \"Price action analysis reveals that TCS has shifted from making lower highs and lower lows to a tight sideways range between ₹3,410 and ₹3,450. There is strong defense at ₹3,410, evident from multiple failed breakdown attempts. While the lack of a hammer or bullish engulfing pattern means buyers are tentative, the stabilization suggests the trend could switch to range-bound unless another negative trigger emerges. Drawing short-term trendlines and using volume-at-price clustering would reinforce this narrative, with the next move likely catalyzed by external news or a heavy volume breakout.\",\n  \"StrategyAndRiskAssessment\": \"ATR over the past 5 days is approximately ₹30–32, implying modest intraday volatility for a stock of TCS’s size. Given prevailing sector risks, a prudent dynamic stop-loss is set just below ₹3,410 (about 0.7% from current levels), and a logical initial target is the ₹3,510–₹3,520 region—yielding a risk/reward near 2:1. Be prepared for extra volatility on sector news. Entry should be limited to the ₹3,430–₹3,440 zone—close to recent support and favorable for reward/risk balance. If holding, consider a trailing stop just below the key support. Risk factors include sector-wide sentiment swings and any fresh negative news; conversely, a close above ₹3,450 on higher volume would be a bullish green flag.\",\n  \"DynamicLevels\": {\n    \"StopLoss\": \"₹3,400 (about 1% below recent support/entry)\",\n    \"ProfitTarget\": \"₹3,510–₹3,520 (2–2.5% above entry, matching next resistance zone)\",\n    \"EntryZone\": \"₹3,430–₹3,440 (sideways base, near support)\",\n    \"ExitZone\": \"₹3,510–₹3,520 (recent resistance, chart cluster)\"\n  },\n  \"Final Commentary\": \"TCS currently sits at a technically significant juncture, with sector malaise keeping upside in check and technicals suggesting consolidation rather than aggressive direction. The short-term outlook is for a range-bound market unless the sector sees a sentiment shift or the price decisively breaks present support/resistance. Adherence to risk controls is paramount; avoid overcommitment and adjust positions if the ₹3,410 level fails to hold. Active traders may consider range-trading with tight stops, while investors may watch for news or volume-based confirmation before increasing exposure. For ongoing portfolio management, keep abreast of sector developments—any positive shift could spark a quick recovery in TCS. Further deep-dive requests—such as broader sector or long-term technicals—are welcome.\"\n}"
