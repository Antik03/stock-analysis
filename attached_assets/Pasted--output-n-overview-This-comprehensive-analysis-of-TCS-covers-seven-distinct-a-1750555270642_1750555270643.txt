    "output": "{\n  \"overview\": \"This comprehensive analysis of TCS covers seven distinct areas: trend, key drivers, support & resistance, volume, market sentiment, risk, and actionable insights. Each aspect is deeply explored using the latest data, technicals, news flows, and volatility metrics to provide a clear, balanced view.\",\n  \"MarketSnapshot\": \"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is currently trading at ₹3,435.7. Its daily high and low were ₹3,446.3 and ₹3,410.9, respectively. The last five closing prices — ₹3,496.3, ₹3,515.3, ₹3,451.4, ₹3,424.0, and ₹3,435.7 — highlight a short-term downtrend that has recently slowed with signs of stabilization. The 52-week price range spans from ₹3,056.05 to ₹4,592.25, situating TCS in the lower-mid spectrum of its annual range. Trading volumes spiked during the steepest decline but fell as prices stabilized, indicating that fresh selling is tapering off. Overall, the trend has shifted from bearish momentum to cautious consolidation, as reflected by both price and volume behavior.\",\n  \"NewsAnalysis\": \"Recent news cycles have focused heavily on the global IT sector, particularly in relation to Accenture and macroeconomic headwinds. Accenture's share plunge despite solid earnings sparked downward pressure on Indian IT peers, including TCS, as market participants reassess growth outlooks amid muted guidance and global client caution. Another theme is sector risk from macro factors like tariffs, conflict, and client spending hesitancy. No recent negative events are company-specific for TCS, but sector drag affects sentiment. The overall tone remains moderately negative, not from TCS-specific performance, but industrywide caution — meaning investor confidence is subdued though not alarmist.\",\n  \"TechnicalChartInterpretation\": \"The recent chart for TCS displays a run of strong red candles followed by small-bodied candles, signalling that the downtrend is losing momentum and consolidation is setting in. No overt bullish reversal candlestick is present, but the price has repeatedly held above ₹3,410, forming a short-term floor. The MACD lines (not explicitly shown but inferred from price flattening) appear to be converging, suggesting bearish momentum is dissipating. The RSI sits at 39.12, approaching oversold but not yet rebounding — reflecting a market that's tired rather than ripe for upside. Stochastic RSI is in overbought territory, supporting the thesis that any bounce should be watched for exhaustion. Volume analysis reveals heavier activity during the breakdown, tapering off as prices base out, a classic sign of potential seller exhaustion. Immediate support is at ₹3,410 with minor resistance at ₹3,445–3,451, aligning with recent clustering and prior breakdowns.\",\n  \"PriceActionAnalysis\": \"Raw price action clearly illustrates lower highs and lower lows, transitioning into a consolidation pattern above key support. No textbook bullish reversal (like a hammer or engulfing candle) has yet emerged, but the clustering of closes above ₹3,410 is constructive. Price action indicates the bears are taking profits and stepping aside, but buyers have not yet regained control. Drawing trendlines from recent highs would show a downward sloping line, with short-term range-bound trading between support and resistance levels. This pattern affirms the signals from technical indicators: the previous trend’s force is diminishing, but no new direction has been confirmed.\",\n  \"StrategyAndRiskAssessment\": \"Dynamic risk management is essential here. Computing ATR from recent sessions gives a volatility band of ~₹56.6, so a prudent stop-loss would be at ₹3,379 (1.6% below current price). For healthy risk/reward (2:1), look for a profit target near ₹3,548 (3.3% above). Entries near ₹3,430–3,440 are logical, close to support and volume base. If holding, consider trailing a stop under ₹3,410. Risk is presently twofold: fundamental (sector sentiment) and technical (support violation). Green flags include holding the recent floor and waning sell interest. Red flags would be any breakdown below ₹3,410 or further sector news shocks. Discipline is key: obey stops, avoid chasing, and watch for confirmation before scaling up.\",\n  \"DynamicLevels\": {\n    \"StopLoss\": \"₹3,379 (1.6% below entry at current price)\",\n    \"ProfitTarget\": \"₹3,548 (3.3% above entry at current price)\",\n    \"EntryZone\": \"₹3,430–₹3,440 (proximate to current levels and short-term support)\",\n    \"ExitZone\": \"₹3,540–₹3,550 (near the next resistance identified in consolidation highs)\"\n  },\n  \"Final Commentary\": \"TCS is at a technical and sentiment crossroads. The downward momentum appears spent for now, but upside is capped by continued sectoral worries and lack of bullish triggers. Price action above ₹3,410 and falling volume signal a truce between buyers and sellers rather than a reversal. Actionable insights point to range-trading the support/resistance bands with tight risk controls, not aggressive directional bets. Long-term investors should keep an eye on further IT sector news, as a positive shift could catalyze recovery, while a break of recent support would warrant a defensive strategy. If you’d like a deeper dive, longer-term Fibo mapping, or sector-relative performance, just ask — I’m here to support your analysis needs.\"\n}"
