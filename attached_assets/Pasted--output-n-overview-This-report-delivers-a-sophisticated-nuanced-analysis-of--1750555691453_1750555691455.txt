    "output": "{\n  \"overview\": \"This report delivers a sophisticated, nuanced analysis of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), segmented into trend, key drivers, support/resistance, volume, sentiment, risk, and actionable guidance. Insights are data-driven and sector-contextualized for maximum practical value, without issuing any direct buy/sell calls.\",\n  \"MarketSnapshot\": \"TCS last closed at ₹3,435.70, with a session high of ₹3,446.30 and a low of ₹3,410.90. Over the last five sessions, closing prices trended down from ₹3,496.30 to ₹3,435.70. Trading volume surged on sharper declines and then diminished as prices stabilized, indicating capitulation selling may be winding down. The current price sits toward the middle-lower end of its 52-week range (₹3,056.05–₹4,592.25), reflecting a medium-term bearish-to-sideways phase after significant correction.\",\n  \"NewsAnalysis\": \"Recent headlines are heavily influenced by Accenture's earnings and sectoral drag, not TCS-specific issues. Accenture's sharp share drop on tepid guidance slashed sentiment across IT majors, including TCS, as clients globally grow cautious amid geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds (wars, tariffs, cautious client spending). There is also coverage of adjacent Tata companies navigating global trade frictions. Overall, the tone is moderately negative for the sector, lowering investor appetite despite no direct negative events for TCS itself.\",\n  \"TechnicalChartInterpretation\": \"Daily candles reveal a string of red bars (persistent selling), succeeded by a sequence of smaller-bodied candles, pointing to consolidation. No overt bullish reversal pattern is present, but consistent support is observed nearby ₹3,410, with frequent tests but no sustained breach. The MACD is narrowing, reflecting waning bearish momentum. RSI is at 39.12—underscoring tired selling but not enough to trigger an oversold bounce. Volume has dropped as the stock bases, a classic signal that sellers are exiting the stage. Key resistance sits just over ₹3,450, matching both historical pivot and recent breakdown rally highs.\",\n  \"PriceActionAnalysis\": \"Raw price action is characterized by lower highs and lower lows giving way to sideways movement, with the ₹3,410–₹3,450 band acting as a clear battleground. No powerful reversal candle (like hammer or bullish engulfing) is visible, but repeated defense of ₹3,410 signals a pause in downward momentum. This aligns with technicals: exhausted sellers, patient buyers. Both trendlines and short-term Fibo retracements would highlight ₹3,410 as support and ₹3,445–₹3,450 as resistance. Confirmation of direction depends on a decisive break from this narrow zone, making it a focal point for near-term strategies.\",\n  \"StrategyAndRiskAssessment\": \"With a 5-day ATR of approximately ₹30.5 and sector volatility heightened by news, risk management must be adaptive. For fresh entries, the optimal zone is ₹3,430–₹3,440, placing a dynamic stop-loss near ₹3,380 (roughly 1.5x ATR below current price/support) and an initial target at ₹3,510–₹3,520 (just above next resistance, reflecting 2x ATR move). News sensitivity adds risk of sudden spikes, so tight position sizing and trailing stops are recommended. Watch for a 'green flag' close above ₹3,450 with volume for bullish confidence; a breach below ₹3,410—especially on high volume—signals a red flag for further downside. Maintain discipline: obey stops, avoid overtrading, and manage risk given the lack of strong positive headlines or clear reversal on the chart.\",\n  \"DynamicLevels\": {\n    \"StopLoss\": \"₹3,380 (1.6% below entry/support, sized ~1.5x ATR)\",\n    \"ProfitTarget\": \"₹3,510–₹3,520 (2x ATR above entry, at next resistance zone)\",\n    \"EntryZone\": \"₹3,430–₹3,440 (near support and low of base)\",\n    \"ExitZone\": \"₹3,510–₹3,520 (resistance cluster from recent price action)\"\n  },\n  \"Final Commentary\": \"TCS is a high-quality stock navigating both sector-wide caution and technical exhaustion. While downward momentum is fading, a clear bullish reversal is absent, so it is best viewed as a range-bound, cautious play until confirmed signals arrive. Actionable approach: trade the range with defined stops/targets, size positions modestly, and stay attuned to sector news for sentiment shifts. For long-term investors, accumulate only if base-building above ₹3,410 persists.
